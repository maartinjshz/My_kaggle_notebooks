# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The Titanic ML competition is the first challange whne diving into ML competitions on Kaggle. In this competition, given data about passengers, is to make a model that is to predict whether or not people on survived the tradegy.

Because I am learning along the way, I have made a notebook for my first attempt to this competition with an intention to improve it over time.
